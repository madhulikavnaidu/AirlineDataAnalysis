Hadoop & Big Data Project 
AIRLINE ANALYSIS


Step 1:
•	Downloading the given dataset and using unrar command to unrar the rar files.
•	Creating a directory(Airlines) and copying the data files into this new directory.
Syntax – 
Hadoop hdfs –copyFromLocal home/edureka/Downloads/Final_airlines  /Airlines
Step 2: 
•	Using Pig script to execute the problem statements.

Question A
Find list of Airports operating in the Country India 

A = load '/Airlines/airports_mod.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (AirportID:int, Airportname:chararray, city:chararray, country:chararray, IATA:chararray, ICAO:chararray, latitude:float, longitude:float, altitude:int, timezone:double, dst:chararray, tz:chararray);
B = filter A by country == 'India';
C = foreach B generate Airportname;
store C into '/Airlines/ResultA';

Question B
B. Find the list of Airlines having zero stops

A = load '/Airlines/Final_airlines' using PigStorage(',')  as (airlineID:int, airlinename:chararray, alias:chararray, IATA:chararray, ICAO:chararray, callsign:chararray, Country:chararray, active:chararray);
B = load '/Airlines/routes.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (airline:chararray, airlineID:int, sourceairport:chararray, sourceID: int, destairport:chararray, destID:int, codeshare:chararray, stops: int,equipment:chararray);
C = filter B by stops == 0;
D = join C by airlineID, A by airlineID; 
E = foreach D generate airlinename;
F = distinct E;
store F into '/Airlines/Result(B)';

Question C
 List of Airlines operating with code share 

A = load '/Airlines/Final_airlines' using PigStorage(',')  as (airlineID:int, airlinename:chararray, alias:chararray, IATA:chararray, ICAO:chararray, callsign:chararray, Country:chararray, active:chararray);
B = load '/Airlines/routes.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (airline:chararray, airlineID:int, sourceairport:chararray, sourceID: int, destairport:chararray, destID:int, codeshare:chararray, stops: int,equipment:chararray);
C = filter B by codeshare == 'Y';
D = join C by airlineID, A by airlineID;
E = foreach D generate airlinename;
F = distinct E;
store G into '/Airlines/Result-C';

Question D
 Which country (or) territory having highest Airports

A = load '/Airlines/airports_mod.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (AirportID:int, Airportname:chararray, city:chararray, country:chararray, IATA:chararray, ICAO:chararray, latitude:float, longitude:float, altitude:int, timezone:double, dst:chararray, tz:chararray);
B = foreach A generate country, Airportname; 
C = group B by country;
D = foreach C generate flatten (group) as country, COUNT(B) as total;
E = order D by total DESC;
F = limit E 1;
store F into '/Airlines/RESULT-D';


Question E 
 Find the list of Active Airlines in United States.


A = load '/Airlines/Final_airlines' using PigStorage(',')  as  
(airlineID:int, airlinename:chararray, alias:chararray,  
IATA:chararray, ICAO:chararray, callsign:chararray,  
Country:chararray, active:chararray);

B = load '/Airlines/routes.dat' using PigStorage(',') as  
(airline:chararray, airlineID:int, sourceairport:chararray,  
sourceID: int, destairport:chararray, destID:int,  
codeshare:chararray, stops: int,equipment:chararray);

C = distinct B;

D = join C by airlineID, A by airlineID;   

E = filter D by active  == 'Y';

F = foreach E generate airlinename, Country, active;

G = filter F by Country == 'United States';

H = distinct G;

store H into '/Airline/Result-E';
